# SAP_CPI_SecurityMaterial_Export

SAP CPI â€“ Fetch & Encrypt Security Material
Overview
This SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) artifact automates the retrieval of **User Credentials, OAuth2 Client Credentials, and Secure Parameters** from CPIâ€™s **Security Material**. The extracted data is formatted as a **CSV file**, **encrypted using PGP**, and sent as an **email attachment** to ensure secure credential handling.
Features
âœ… Fetch User Credentials, OAuth2 Client Credentials, and Secure Parameters from Security Material
âœ… Format the credentials into a structured CSV file
âœ… Apply PGP encryption to protect sensitive information
âœ… Send the encrypted file via email as an attachment
âœ… Ensure compliance by preventing local storage risks
âœ… Decrypt the encrypted file securely when needed
Installation
1. Import the Artifact into SAP CPI
1. Download the **iFlow artifact (.zip)** from this repository (`iFlow/` folder).
2. Log in to **SAP CPI Web UI**.
3. Navigate to **Design > Your Package > Artifacts > Add > Integration Flow**.
4. Click **Import** and upload the `.zip` file.
5. Deploy the iFlow after successful import.
2. Configure Required Parameters
In the **iFlowâ€™s Integration Process**, update the following properties:
Property Name	Description
MailReceiver	Email ID of the recipient
PGP_PublicKey	The public key used for encryption
CredentialName	Name of the Security Material credential to fetch
SecureParamName	Secure Parameter to retrieve
**Note:** Ensure that the **PGP public key** is uploaded in CPIâ€™s **Security Material** section.
Usage
1. **Trigger the iFlow** via a manual test or scheduled execution.
2. **Monitor the execution** in CPIâ€™s **Monitoring Dashboard**.
3. **Check the email inbox** of the recipient to find the encrypted CSV file.
Decrypting the Encrypted File
To view the original CSV data, follow these steps:
1. Use a **PGP decryption tool** such as **GnuPG, Kleopatra, or OpenPGP Studio**.
2. Import your **PGP private key** into the tool.
3. Decrypt the email attachment to retrieve the original **CSV file**.
